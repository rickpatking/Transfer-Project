## Problem Statement

The college basketball transfer portal has revolutionized player mobility, with over 1,600+ Division I players entering annually. However, predicting transfer success remains largely intuition-based. This project develops a data-driven approach to:

- **Predict transfer success** using pre-transfer performance and contextual factors
- **Identify player archetypes** through unsupervised learning on play-style metrics  
- **Quantify key factors** that influence transfer outcomes
- **Provide actionable insights** for coaches, athletic directors, and players

## Dataset

### Data Sources
- **Sports Reference (CBB):** Historical player statistics, advanced metrics
- **Transfer Portal Tracking:** Player movement data, timeline information
- **KenPom:** Team efficiency and strength metrics

### Data Scope
- **Players:** 5,000+ Division I transfers (2019-2024)
- **Features:** 50+ statistical and contextual variables
- **Success Metrics:** Based on change in PER currently, I hopt to change to a more advanced Multi-dimensional success definition incorporating performance, playing time, and team success changes in the future

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Engineering
```python
# Advanced feature engineering example
features = [
    'points_per_100_possessions', 'usage_rate', 'true_shooting_pct',
    'team_quality_change', 'conference_strength_diff', 'role_change_indicator'
]
```

### 2. Play-Style Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Algorithm:** K-Means clustering on normalized per-possession statistics
- **Features:** Usage rate, shooting efficiency, rebounding rates, assist rates
- **Output:** 5 distinct player archetypes:
  - Defensive and Hustling Bench Forward
  - Role Player 
  - High Usage Scoring Guard
  - All Around Wing
  - Low Impact Guard

### 3. Transfer Success Prediction (Supervised Learning)
- **Target Variable:** Composite success score (0-100) based on:
  - Performance improvement (PER, efficiency metrics)
  - Playing time increase
  - Team success contribution
- **Models Tested:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- **Best Model:** Random Forest with 79.7% accuracy

## Key Findings

### Top Predictive Features
1. **Win Share/40 min** (15% feature importance)
2. **Offense Win Shares** (8% feature importance)  
3. **Play Style/Role** (7% feature importance)
4. **Win Share** (5% feature importance)
5. **Strength of Schedule Change** (4% feature importance)

## Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 78.2% |
| **Precision** | 76.8% |
| **Recall** | 79.1% |
| **F1-Score** | 77.9% |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.851 |

### Cross-Validation Results
- **5-Fold CV Mean:** 77.4% ± 2.1%
- **Stable performance** across different data splits
